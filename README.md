To use the Website-Template, first clone the repository to your local machine using Git, then navigate into the project folder and install all dependencies using npm install; once installed, you can start the development server with npm run dev to preview the site locally, after which you can begin customizing the template by editing titles, sections, images, and styles in the src directory, including modifying layout components and uploading your own images either locally or via base64; when you're ready to launch, you can build the project for production using npm run build, which generates an optimized dist folder, and then you can deploy the contents of the dist folder to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or manually to your server, all while optionally running tests if you've enabled them, and ensuring that youâ€™re following the MIT License terms if you distribute or modify the template.
